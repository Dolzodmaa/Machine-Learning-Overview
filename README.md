# Machine-Learning-Overview

## Supervised
--------
Use cases: Prediction, classification and labeling, quntification of risk and uncertinty, feedback based recomendation
Examples: Sales forecasting, Vegas odds, insurance risk, credit fraud detection

### Regression
* Least Squares
* Sequential
* Penalized Regression
   * Ridge
   * LASSO
   * Group LASSO, Elastic Net ...
* Gaussian Process regression
* Decision Tree
* Neural Networks 

### Classification
* KNN
* Decision Tree

### Feature Importance
* Factor Analysis

### Supervised Dimensionality Reduction
* LDA
* DAPC

## Unsupervised
--------
Use cases: Structure Discovery, grouping/labeling when no labels are known, implicit recomendation, improve supervised methods
Examples: Youtube Recomendations, google translate 

### Dimensionality Reduction
* PCA
* T-SNE
* Vector Embeddings/Distributed Representations
* Matrix Factorization
* Autoencoders

### Non-Parametric Classification
* Gaussian Mixture Models
* Dirichlet Process Models
* DBSCAN

## Other Domains that are Interestingly Different
--------
Use cases: A/B/C... tests, maintain equalibrium or setpoint, explore/exploit optimization 
Examples:Website optimization, content personalization, auto pilot

### Autonomus Control/Decision Theory
* PID Algorithm
* Bandit Algorithms
* Reinforcement Learning
